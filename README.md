Monastery! The Game!
======================

Monastery is a game that was designed and prototyped in 24 hours for the OSGCC 6 by the Pumpkin Eaters team consisting of Andrea Della Corte, Rob Filippi, Mike Minella. To read more about the OSGCC visit http://osgcc.org.

In this game you are the chef of the Monastery, a huge spaceship where food is running scarce!

But, when everything seemed lost, the Monastery landed on a wonderful planet full of vegetables! Bad thing is... The plants on this planet walk and are invading your space kitchen!!

Can you restore the botanic order by bringing the invaders to the cooking hearth and keeping your comrades from starvation?

Good luck, space chef!
